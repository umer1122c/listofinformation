                    <p>Globaboom programmes are focused mainly toward the FUTURE. To achieve this, we should understand where we are coming from and where we are presently. In other words, we should strive to understand the relevant history of our areas of interests or studies, especially from the shoulders of ‘GIANTS’. Then, and only then we can usher-in the FUTURE through creative freedom. So, with that in mind, we will be offering the following two programmes initially. We are hoping to engage participants through live streaming in the following:</p>
                    <p>1. Mentorship<br>2. Motivational Talks.</p>
                    <p>The objectives of these two programmes are to mentor and to motivate; while at the same time gather feedback of your interest and to observe how you are impacting positively on the changing world. This would further guide us in the development and presentation of educational and training contents and materials which will be incorporated in the programmes.</p>
