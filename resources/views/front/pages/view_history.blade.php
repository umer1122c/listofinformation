                    <h2>History of Globaboom</h2>
                    <p>I had a very joyful, curious and an adventurous childhood. These qualities accompanied me into my 20’s and beyond and which led me to get actively involved in many organizations/clubs. The experiences gained from these involvements were amazing and enlightening.
                    </p>
                   <p>Sometime around the mid 1970's, after the 'birth' of the 'energy crisis', I applied for a loan of $20 000 Jamaican dollars, (approximately 22 000 US dollars at that time) from a lending agency in Jamaica, (January 2019, 1 USD~137 JMD). The loan was for an attempt to start a well needed Science Centre. Upon the recommendation from the lending agency I had to meet with other agencies in relations to the Science centre proposal. My understanding was that the application was recommended for approval but unfortunately, it was cancelled after meeting with the latter Agencies.
                </p>

                    <p>My work in science and technology during the 1970’s and the 1980’s was recognized by groups such as The Chinese Benevolent Society, The World Bank and The Canadian Community Colleges, to name a few. They provided some funding between the 1970’s and the 1990’s, not for the Science Centre, but for me to improve my knowledge and understanding and to gain experiences through training in few areas of science and technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>By then, the mid 1990’s saw the Internet growing; so between my activities as an educator, raising a family and my idea, I started thinking about developing an online programme. This idea has evolved overtime into GLOBABOOM after many moons of trials, errors and name changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am grateful to be still standing on the shoulders of giants such as-the Lending Agency and other Agencies that met with me. Over the decades of internalization, I have arrived at the conclusion that they were just great learning experiences-moments.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am also grateful to the Chinese Benevolent Society, the World Bank and the Canadian Community Colleges for showing that, I CAN. I am also grateful to my many mentors, motivators and trainers over the decades. They are just too many to mention here. However, I hope that someday I will be able to mention all, with PRIDE, JOY and HONOUR, while still standing, rather, sitting on their SHOULDERS.
